# How to Run Dev and Test Environment

## Dependencies
- Godot 4.4 (.NET version)
- .NET SDK 
### Downloading Dependencies
Godot Download (Be absolutely certain you download the one marked "Godot Engine - .NET" ) -> https://godotengine.org/download/windows/ 
.NET SDK -> https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
A warning taken from the Godot download page: 
Note: The .NET binaries run only on Windows systems with the matching architecture, running under emulation is not supported at the time being. Make sure to export .NET binaries for all target platforms (x86_64, x86_32, and arm64).

## Running the project

Once Godot and the .NET SDK are installed, download the project .ZIP file. Open Godot, and you'll be taken to a screen titled "Project manager". Click the import button, then, within the menu that pops up, find the .zip in your downloads, and open. From there, you can Edit or Run the project. 

Edit mode lets you access the Debug menus, the console, change project settings, and generally do whatever else you want to the code in the process.
